# Prompt 02 - Backend Foundation and Runtime Baseline

You are implementing part of a POC internal KMS Bot system.

Business context:
- The system is a POC / V1 intelligent Q&A system for a public Confluence KMS space
- The Confluence KMS space is a cross-team public knowledge space
- There is no ACL / permission filtering requirement in V1
- Confluence is the only source of truth
- The goal is to sync knowledge from Confluence, process it, index it, retrieve relevant chunks, and generate answers with citations

Architecture constraints:
- Frontend: React + TypeScript
- Backend: Python 3.11+, FastAPI, Pydantic
- Local storage: files + SQLite
- Search: Azure AI Search
- LLM: Azure OpenAI
- Deployment: Docker
- One unified pipeline_version field is used for reprocessing control
- Business strategy must live in the backend, not in Azure Portal settings
- Prompts must be stored in backend prompt template files, not in frontend settings
- No advanced agent workflow
- No vector search / hybrid search / reranking in POC
- No metrics platform and no separate operations platform in POC
- Keep the implementation simple, modular, debuggable, and easy to integrate

Required API family for the final system:
- POST /api/sync/full
- POST /api/sync/incremental
- GET  /api/sync/status
- POST /api/index/rebuild
- GET  /api/index/status
- POST /api/query
- GET  /api/health

Required data contracts for the final system:
Registry table fields:
- page_id
- title
- source_version
- last_updated
- raw_hash
- chunk_count
- pipeline_version
- index_status
- last_sync_time
- last_index_time
- error_message

Cleaned document JSON shape:
{
  "doc_id": "12345",
  "title": "How to reset iPension access",
  "sections": [
    {"heading": "Overview", "content": "..."},
    {"heading": "Steps", "content": "..."}
  ],
  "plain_text": "..."
}

Chunk JSON shape:
{
  "chunk_id": "12345#steps#1",
  "doc_id": "12345",
  "title": "How to reset iPension access",
  "section": "Steps",
  "content": "Step 1 ... Step 2 ...",
  "url": "...",
  "tags": ["ipension", "access", "reset"],
  "pipeline_version": 1
}

Query API target response shape:
{
  "answer": "...",
  "sources": [
    {
      "title": "How to reset iPension access",
      "url": "...",
      "section": "Steps",
      "doc_id": "12345",
      "chunk_id": "12345#steps#1"
    }
  ],
  "related_documents": [
    {
      "page_id": "12345",
      "title": "...",
      "url": "..."
    }
  ],
  "debug": {
    "normalized_query": "...",
    "selected_chunks": []
  }
}

General coding rules:
- Keep code modular and easy to integrate
- Do not introduce unnecessary frameworks
- Do not implement ACL logic
- Do not implement unsupported future features
- Add minimal error handling and debug-friendly logging
- Make outputs runnable locally
- If a dependency is not implemented yet, use a clean interface or mock placeholder instead of inventing hidden coupling
- Preserve a clean separation between sync, parse, chunk, search, answer, API, frontend, and integration concerns

Always produce in your response:
1. file tree changes
2. full code files
3. config changes
4. explicit input/output contract of this module
5. integration notes
6. acceptance checklist


Task:
Implement the backend foundation for the POC KMS Bot using FastAPI. This prompt must create the stable runtime base that all backend feature modules can plug into.

What to implement:
- FastAPI application entrypoint
- application factory or equivalent clean startup pattern
- config loading using environment variables plus YAML
- base settings models
- router registration structure
- health endpoint
- unified API response wrapper models if appropriate
- structured logging setup
- exception handling middleware or handlers
- SQLite connection setup
- base repository pattern or simple DB access baseline
- dependency injection pattern for services
- placeholder service interfaces for sync, parse, chunk, search, and answer modules

Required output endpoints at this stage:
- GET /api/health must work
- placeholder routers for the other endpoint families may be included, but business logic should remain stubbed unless truly foundational

Constraints:
- do not implement Confluence sync business logic yet
- do not implement parsing or chunking business logic yet
- do not implement Azure AI Search integration yet
- do not implement Azure OpenAI integration yet
- do not hardcode secrets
- use the frozen contracts defined in Prompt 01

Decoupling requirement:
- every future backend module should be able to attach to this foundation without rewriting app startup, config loading, logging, or DB bootstrap
- expose clear interfaces or placeholders instead of hidden assumptions

Integration notes to include:
- how Prompt 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, and 08 should plug into this backend baseline
