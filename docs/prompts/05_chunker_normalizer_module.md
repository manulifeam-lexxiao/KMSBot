# Prompt 05 - Chunker and Normalizer Module

You are implementing part of a POC internal KMS Bot system.

Business context:
- The system is a POC / V1 intelligent Q&A system for a public Confluence KMS space
- The Confluence KMS space is a cross-team public knowledge space
- There is no ACL / permission filtering requirement in V1
- Confluence is the only source of truth
- The goal is to sync knowledge from Confluence, process it, index it, retrieve relevant chunks, and generate answers with citations

Architecture constraints:
- Frontend: React + TypeScript
- Backend: Python 3.11+, FastAPI, Pydantic
- Local storage: files + SQLite
- Search: Azure AI Search
- LLM: Azure OpenAI
- Deployment: Docker
- One unified pipeline_version field is used for reprocessing control
- Business strategy must live in the backend, not in Azure Portal settings
- Prompts must be stored in backend prompt template files, not in frontend settings
- No advanced agent workflow
- No vector search / hybrid search / reranking in POC
- No metrics platform and no separate operations platform in POC
- Keep the implementation simple, modular, debuggable, and easy to integrate

Required API family for the final system:
- POST /api/sync/full
- POST /api/sync/incremental
- GET  /api/sync/status
- POST /api/index/rebuild
- GET  /api/index/status
- POST /api/query
- GET  /api/health

Required data contracts for the final system:
Registry table fields:
- page_id
- title
- source_version
- last_updated
- raw_hash
- chunk_count
- pipeline_version
- index_status
- last_sync_time
- last_index_time
- error_message

Cleaned document JSON shape:
{
  "doc_id": "12345",
  "title": "How to reset iPension access",
  "sections": [
    {"heading": "Overview", "content": "..."},
    {"heading": "Steps", "content": "..."}
  ],
  "plain_text": "..."
}

Chunk JSON shape:
{
  "chunk_id": "12345#steps#1",
  "doc_id": "12345",
  "title": "How to reset iPension access",
  "section": "Steps",
  "content": "Step 1 ... Step 2 ...",
  "url": "...",
  "tags": ["ipension", "access", "reset"],
  "pipeline_version": 1
}

Query API target response shape:
{
  "answer": "...",
  "sources": [
    {
      "title": "How to reset iPension access",
      "url": "...",
      "section": "Steps",
      "doc_id": "12345",
      "chunk_id": "12345#steps#1"
    }
  ],
  "related_documents": [
    {
      "page_id": "12345",
      "title": "...",
      "url": "..."
    }
  ],
  "debug": {
    "normalized_query": "...",
    "selected_chunks": []
  }
}

General coding rules:
- Keep code modular and easy to integrate
- Do not introduce unnecessary frameworks
- Do not implement ACL logic
- Do not implement unsupported future features
- Add minimal error handling and debug-friendly logging
- Make outputs runnable locally
- If a dependency is not implemented yet, use a clean interface or mock placeholder instead of inventing hidden coupling
- Preserve a clean separation between sync, parse, chunk, search, answer, API, frontend, and integration concerns

Always produce in your response:
1. file tree changes
2. full code files
3. config changes
4. explicit input/output contract of this module
5. integration notes
6. acceptance checklist


Task:
Implement the Chunker / Normalizer module that consumes cleaned document JSON and emits chunk JSON artifacts aligned with the frozen chunk schema. This module must be independently runnable after the parser stage.

What to implement:
- chunker service
- heading-first chunking strategy
- secondary splitting for oversized sections
- topical chunk preservation rules
- deterministic chunk_id generation
- optional simple tag extraction strategy if reasonable and deterministic
- chunk JSON persistence
- registry chunk_count update

Required chunk output fields:
- chunk_id
- doc_id
- title
- section
- content
- url
- tags
- pipeline_version

Constraints:
- no embeddings
- no vector logic
- no Azure integration
- do not make chunking depend on answer generation or frontend concerns

Decoupling requirement:
- consume only cleaned JSON plus minimal required metadata
- emit chunk JSON that search indexing can consume without knowing parser internals
- define how this module behaves if some cleaned sections are empty or malformed

Include in your response:
- chunk sizing rules
- chunk_id format rules
- chunk artifact storage rules
- registry update rules for chunk_count
